# CUSTOMERS APP#

The **Customers App** web application is aimed to our sales people so that they can have access to our customer's contact information. 

## **User-Interface** ##

It's front-end is composed by the following screens.

### **Welcome Screen** ###

The Welcome Screen presents the user to a form where he/she can be identified. The form consists of:

- **Instructions** text: "Please provide your name:";
- A **text field** where the user will input his/her name; and
- A **Submit** button;

When the user fills in his/her name and click the button, the **Customer List Screen** is presented. If the user clicks the button leaving the text field blank, an alert message is presented: **Please provide your name**.

### **Customer List Screen** ###

This screen presents the list of all registered customers. For each customer, the following info is shown:

- **Name**
- **# of Employees**
- **Size**: if **# of Employees** is less than or equal 100, size is **Small**; if greater then 10 and less then or equal 1000, **Medium**; otherwise, **Big**

When the user clicks on a customer name, the **Contacts Detail Screen** is shown.

### **Contacts Detail Screen** ###

This screen shows the customers detailed info (Name, # of Employees, and Size) and also the name and e-mail of the person in the company to be contacted.

When a customer doesn't have contact info, the message **No contact info available** should be presented.

A **Back to the list** button is also presented. When it is clicked, the user is taken back to **Customer List Screen**.
